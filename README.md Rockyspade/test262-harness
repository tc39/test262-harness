# Test262-Harness

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bterlson/test262-harness.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bterlson/test262-harness)

## Getting Started

### For Development of Test262-Harness

For development of Test262-harness, test authoring & execution:

```
git clone https://github.com/tc39/test262.git --depth 1
cd test262
```

### For Test Authoring & Test Execution: 

For test authoring & execution:
```
npm install -g test262-harness
```

Run `test262-harness --help` for details on the various configuration options.

### Examples

Running tests in hypothetical JavaScript engine "X": 

```
cd test262;
test262-harness --host-type=X --host-path=`which X` test/**/*.js
```




## Options

| Option Name | Description | Required | Default |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help & examples | n/a | n/a |
| `-v`, `--version` | Print the current version of test262-harness | n/a | n/a |
| `--host-type` | Type of host to run tests in. See [eshost's supported hosts](https://github.com/bterlson/eshost#supported-hosts) for available options. | No | `node`
| `--host-path` | Path to the host executable. | Yes, if `host-type` is specified | `process.execPath`
| `--host-args` | Any additional arguments to pass to the host when invoking it (eg. `--harmony`, `--es6all`, etc). | No | n/a |
| `-t`, `--threads` | Run this many tests in parallel. Note that the browser runners don't work great with t > 1. | No | 1 |
| `-r`, `--reporter` | Format of data written to standard output. Currently either `json` or `simple`. | No |  `simple` |
| `--features` (deprecated) | Comma-separated list of [`features`](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/master/features.txt) to filter for. Example: `--features="BigInt,Atomics"`. | No | n/a |
| `--features-include` | Comma-separated list of [`features`](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/master/features.txt) to filter for _inclusion_. Example: `--features-include="BigInt,Atomics"` would run only tests that include the features `BigInt` and `Atomics` | No | n/a |
| `--features-exclude` | Comma-separated list of [`features`](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/master/features.txt) to filter for _exclusion_. Example: `--features-exclude="BigInt,Atomics"` would run only tests that do not include the features `BigInt` and `Atomics`. **NOTE** exclusions are resolved _after_ inclusions. | No | n/a |
| `--reporter-keys` | Comma-separated list of keys to include in output of `json` reporter. | No | n/a |
| `--test262-dir` | Root test262 directory and is used to locate the includes directory. | No | Relative to test files |
| `--includes-dir` | Includes directory. | No | Inferred from `test262-dir` or else detected by walking upward from the first test found. |
| `--tempDir` | Directory that `eshost` will create its temp files in (does not affect location of files created by `--save-compiled-tests` and `--save-only-failed` | No | OS Temp Dir |
| `--prelude` | Path to a file to include before every test (useful for testing polyfills for example); supports multiple `--prelude` parameters | No | n/a |
| `--timeout` | Set a custom test timeout in milliseconds | No | `10000` |
| `--transformer` | Path to module which exports a code transformer function | No | n/a |
| `--preprocessor` | Path to module which exports a map function that operates on each Test262Test object before it executed. | No | n/a |
| `--accept-version` | Execute tests from a version of Test262 that differs from the versions supported by this utility. This may cause the utility to report invalid test results. | No | Inferred from `test262Dir/package.json` |
| `--save-compiled-tests` | Write the compiled version of `path/to/test.js` as `path/to/test.js.<host-type>.<default\|strict>.<pass\|fail>` so that it can be easily re-run under that host. Run `test262-harness --help` for examples. | No | n/a
| `--save-only-failed` | Only save the compiled version of the test if it failed, to help easily repro failed tests (implies `--save-compiled-tests`). | No | n/a
| `--error-for-failures` | Return a non-zero exit code if one or more tests fail. | No | n/a


### Preprocessor

The `--preprocessor` feature allows  a module that exports a map function that operates on each [Test262Test object](https://github.com/bocoup/test262-stream#usage) (ie. the object emitted by Test262-Stream) before their execution.

#### `test.result = Result Object`

In some cases, a preprocessor may want to signal to Test262-Harness that a certain result has already been reached, and that it must not further evaluate the test. To create this signal, the preprocessor creates a [`result`](https://github.com/bterlson/eshost#result-object) property on the Test262Test object, which will indicate to Test262-Harness that it must not evaluate the test, but instead return the value of the [`result`](https://github.com/bterlson/eshost#result-object) property as though the test had been executed. For example, a preprocessor may attempt to transpile the value of `test.contents`â€”which may fail! In the case of failure, the preprocessor can create a [`result`](https://github.com/bterlson/eshost#result-object) property whose value is a [`Result Object`](https://github.com/bterlson/eshost#result-object). This will skip the code evaluation and report the given result object. 

```js
module.exports = function(test) {
  try {
    test.contents = babel.transform(test.contents, options).code;
  } catch (error) {
    test.result = {
      stderr: `${error.name}: ${error.message}\n`,
      stdout: '',
      error
    };
  }

  return test;
};
```
